difference between HTTP1.1 and HTTP2

HTTP1.1

> It introduced a Keep alive mechanism.
> It works on Textual format
> A connection could be reuse for more than single request.
> Pipeline was added. This allows the client to send multiple request before waiting for each respose.
> The Persistent connections reduce request latency because client does not need to initiate expensive TCP three-way handshake for every request.
> Additional cache control mechanism were introduced.
> The response must be received in the same order as to requests order.
> Including language, encoding and type also introduced.

HTTP2

> We have a HTTP streams.
> It works on the binary protocol.
> It's a binary protocol rather than a text protocol.It can't be read and created manually.
> It's a Multiplexed protocol.
> Multiple request could be sent to the same server on a single TCP connection.
> It compresses headers. As these are often similar among a set of request, this removes the duplication and overhead of data transmitted.
> Also that HTTP/2 introduced a push capability to allow servers to send updated to the clients whenever new data is available.
> This we can call it as a server-push function.
