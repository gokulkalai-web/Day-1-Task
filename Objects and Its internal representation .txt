> Objects is the most important data-type and forms building blocks of the modern Javascript.

> These objects are quite differ from Javascript primitive datatypes(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol).

> Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types.

> Object is an reference data type.
> Object in Javascript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, primitive types, in the form of "Key:value" pair.

Objects and properties:
> Javascript object has properties associated with it.
> object properties are basically the same as ordinary Javascript variable.
eg: 

ObjectName.propertyName

> Both the object name and property name are case sensitive.

var bike = new Object();
bike.color = "black";
bike.model = "pulser";

> Properties of Javascript objects can also be accessed or set using a bracket notation.

bike['model'] = 'pulser';
bike['color'] = 'black';

> object property name can be any valid Javascript String or anything converted into a string.
> Any property name that is not a valid Javascript identifier that can also accessed by bracket notation.


## Creating Objects in Javascript:
> Create Javascript Object with Object Literal
  we can create a javascript object is object literal, simply define the property and values inside curly braces.
  
  let car = {name: 'honda', color: 'white'}

## Create Javascript Object with constructor:
> Constructor is nothing but function and with help of new keyword, constructor function allows to create multiple objects.

ex:
function Vehicle(name, color){
    this.name = name;
    this.color = color;
}
let bike1 = new Vehicle('pulsar', 'black');
let bike2 = new Vehicle('KTM','black');
console.log(bike1.name);
console.log(bike2.name);



## Create objects using new keyword.

var person = new Object();
person.firstname = "kalai";
person.age = 24;

##Create object.create method

> Object can also be created using the object.create().
> It is for prototype object and without constructor method.

var Animal = {
  type: 'Invertebrates', 
  displayType: function() {  
    console.log(this.type);
  }
};

var animal1 = Object.create(Animal);
animal1.displayType();
var cat = Object.create(Animal);
cat.color = 'white';
cat.displayType();
